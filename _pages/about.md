Welcome to my academic website! 

I am pursuing a Master of Science in Signal and Image Processing at Ecole Centrale de Nantes (ECN), with an expected graduation date of September 2024. My academic journey has equipped me with extensive knowledge in areas such as Computer Vision, Spectral and Time-Frequency Analysis, Signal Processing, Artificial Intelligence, and Machine Learning. During my foundation masterâ€™s year at ECN, I developed a strong foundation in Mathematics, Image Methodology, and Control Systems.

I hold a Bachelor of Mechatronics Engineering from the Harbin Institute of Technology, where I gained a comprehensive understanding of Calculus, Probability Theory, Mechanical Design, Dynamics, and Control Systems. My undergraduate studies were highlighted by several awards, including the Second Prize at the China University Intelligent Robot Competition and the International Underwater Robot Competition.

My research and project experience includes an internship focusing on applying AI techniques to undersea optical links, where I am studying and implementing data transmission techniques to improve performance in complex environments. I have also explored ultrasonic imaging through filtered beamforming, remote sensing data unmixing with sparse optimization algorithms, and developed control systems for an inverted pendulum. As a team leader for the International Underwater Robot Competition, I programmed a robot fish using C and stm32 to achieve significant performance enhancements.

I am fluent in English (B2) and Chinese (native), with basic proficiency in French (A2). My technical skills include MATLAB, Python, Anaconda, CAD, SolidWorks, LaTeX, C++, and C. Outside of academics, I have a passion for photography, capturing moments and scenes that inspire me.

Thank you for visiting my website, and I invite you to explore my projects, research, and experiences in greater detail.
